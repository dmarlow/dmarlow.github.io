Well, that didn't last very long. The moment I tried adding a Gist like so on my old blog,

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/dmarlow/2ea49c00ebc2e4e8e951.js"></script>
	
and I wasn't able to upload, was the moment I realized I needed something a little more "fresh".

And now here we are. Migration was painless since I only had three articles. I wish hosting images were a bit easier, but I'm satisfied. I basically copied David Ebbo's site \(after running into his [article](http://blog.davidebbo.com/2014/01/moving-to-github-pages.html) on moving to GitHub Pages\).
